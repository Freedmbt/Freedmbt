Hello!
My name is Bradley Freedman and I am an award-winning programmer and 
an Honors student studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Interdisciplinary 
Studies at James Madison University. I am honored to serve as one of the ten 
ambassadors for the university's Computer Science department and will be furthering 
this work by mentoring children within the field in the coming winter.

I have always valued the work-life balance and as such take equally as much pride 
as I do in my studies in my pursuit of improvement on our school's Club Cross Country 
team. This, alongside my hobbies of programming, longboarding, and playing frisbee, 
comprises the majority of my free time.

Always eager to learn, I have been actively involved within the Computer Science field 
since the age of 11. I published my first viral app at the age of 13 and have since 
taught myself a variety of languages and frameworks. My specializations are in Python, 
Java, C, and C#, as well as teaching and my interests lie in computer vision, augmented reality, and control interfaces.
